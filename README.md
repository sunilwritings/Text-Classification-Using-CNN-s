# Text-Classification-Using-CNN-s

In this repository we will classify documents using convolution neural networks

We have total of 20 types of documents(Text files) and total 18828 documents(text files).

You can download data from this link(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rxD15nyeIPIAZ-J2VYPrDRZI66-TBWvM/view), in that you will get documents.rar folder.

If you unzip that, you will get total of 18828 documnets. document name is defined as'ClassLabel_DocumentNumberInThatLabel'. 
so from document name, you can extract the label for that document.

Now our problem is to classify all the documents into any one of the class.
